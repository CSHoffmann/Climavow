    <div class="about">
        <p>As citizens who are concerned about our climate, researching the issue comes with its challenges. 
        Often what comes up from a quick Google search is either very vague statements about "needing to 
        reduce carbon emissions" or very specialized scientific articles containing information 
        that we lack the expertise to actually understand. To help combat this issue, we created this
        website that visualizes data in a way that is easy to understand for anyone while simultaneously 
        being concrete enough to convey the urgency of acting now to combat climate change.</p>
